Yor our website is now customized, live and looking good. You just have to publish your first blog post:
Edit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md`, deleting the placeholder content and entering your own. If you need a quick primer on writing in Markdown, check out Adam Pritchard’s cheat sheet.

Change the file name to include today’s date and the title of your post. Jekyll requires posts to be named year-month-day-title.md.

Update the title at the top of the Markdown file. Those variables at the top of the blog post are called front matter, which we’ll dig into a little later. In this case, they specify which layout to use and the title of the blog post. Additional front-matter variables exist, such as permalink, tags and category.
